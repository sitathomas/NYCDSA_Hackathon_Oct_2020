Meeting Notes 10.28
Features:
- total seconds per month
- total seconds / day
- length of usage (registration_init_time is start, which is end [transaction_date, membership_expire_date, payment_plan_days])
- cost per day / seconds of service
- average point of skip (needs a definition)
- Percentage skips after 75%
- percentage skips before 25% (or 50%?)
- total_seconds per unique song
- Some metric which correlates with 'searching' (high skipping & low total_seconds per unique song)



two variable tests:
- usage compaired to length of plan
- what does a longer usage (start to current time) correlate with?
- usage versus churn
- length of plan versus churn
